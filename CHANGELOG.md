## [Unreleased]

First public release. Everything below is new, so this section describes what
the project *is* rather than what changed in it.

### The scanner

- **ClamAV-compatible.** Reads CVD/CLD containers and the `.ndb`/`.ldb`/`.hdb`/
  `.mdb`/`.cdb`/`.hsb`/`.pdb`/`.cbc` signature families, speaks the clamd
  protocol, and matches `clamscan`'s output and exit codes.
- **Never a silent clean.** A file that could not be fully examined is reported
  `LIMITS-EXCEEDED`, `UNSCANNABLE` or `PASSWORD-PROTECTED` — never `OK`. This is
  the invariant the rest of the design serves; where ClamAV returns `OK` for a
  file it gave up on, exav does not.
- **65 container formats**, nested arbitrarily deep, all extracted in memory
  under decompression-bomb budgets: archives, disk images, filesystems,
  OLE/OOXML documents, PDF, email, and installer formats. Each is its own Cargo
  feature, so a ZIP-only build is a real build.
- **A native YARA engine** with no `libyara` and no runtime code generation,
  checked against `yara-x` by compiling the same rules with both and comparing
  the matching-rule sets.
- **A sandboxed x86-32 emulator** that unpacks runtime-packed executables by
  running the packer's own stub and capturing the image it rebuilds — so the
  original program is scanned whatever it was packed with.

### Memory safety

`#![forbid(unsafe_code)]` on every crate except `exav`, whose only
exception is the prefork daemon's process management (`fork`, `waitpid`,
`setrlimit`, descriptor passing). No scanned byte reaches any of it.

The x86 decoder — the one component a scanned file drives directly, supplying
control flow rather than data — is `exav-x86`: dependency-free, safe, and
checked instruction by instruction against an independent decoder over
94,245,255 decode sites from real packed malware, agreeing on every one.

### Not included

- No bundled signature URLs. Update sources are supplied by the operator.
- No digital-signature verification of downloaded databases, and no rsync.
- The x86 decoder covers 32-bit protected mode in full — including VEX, EVEX
  and XOP — but only 32-bit mode: no REX, no RIP-relative addressing, no 64-bit
  forms. The emulator runs 32-bit packer stubs.
